# UNCC Android Weather

This was the midterm project from my Mobile Application Development course at UNC Charlotte. It is a simple weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherApp API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

I am keeping this here mostly as a personal reference for when I decide to work with Android again. I am not condoning cheating if you happen to come across this code and are taking the same course, but rather for people to use it as a learning tool.

## Running The App

I built this in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) using the [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) emulator, so I would go ahead and use those to try and running the app.
